# EncryPass
Change your password with the same.
# Synopsis
EncryPass is a tool to always keep the same password and to always have a different.
# Description
Choose a service and enter your usual password, then EncryPass will generate you a new password.
If you forget your password, don't panic, open EncryPass and repeat the operation, EncryPass then give you back your "encrypt" password.
# History
I always wanted to use a different password for each site, but I always had a bad memory, so I create EncryPass, based on the Caesar encryption.
