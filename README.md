# PassPath
Change your password with the same.
# Synopsis
PassPath is a tool to always keep the same password and to always have a different.
# Description
Choose a service and enter your usual password, then PassPath will generate you a new password.
If you forget your password, don't panic, open PassPath and repeat the operation, PassPath then give you back your "encrypt" password.
# History
I always wanted to use a different password for each site, but I always had a bad memory, so I create PassPath, based on the Caesar encryption.
